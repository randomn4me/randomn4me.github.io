Hi, I'm Philipp, father of *four little humans*, research associate at [PEASEC](https://peasec.de), and working on making the worlds information more accessible.
My current research focuses on mitigating information overload for CERTs[^1] and SOCs[^2] and preparing the information used.
I use natural language processing, information retrieval, and data mining methods tailored to common information security tasks.
As an example, my colleague Markus Bayer and I have trained a large language model for the ITSec domain called [CySecBERT](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3652594)[^3].

I'm also interested in automating dumb tasks, NixOS (and [using it for all my machines](https://github.com/randomn4me/nix-flakes)), and I love to ride my bike whenever I find the time ðŸš´
Besides that, I'm sometimes into photography ðŸ“· I usually shoot portraits, nature, or the night sky[^4].

If you want to contact me, feel free to leave me a [message](mailto:blog@audacis.net).

## Now

I'm currently looking for jobs based in the U.S. in the tech industry, so if you know someone (who knows someone (who knows someone, ...)), who is open for a chat, I would really appreciate it! Just contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipp-k%C3%BChn-724a7a320/) or via [mail](mailto:blog@audacis.net).

Besides that, I'm
- working on two different paper projects to mitigate information overload and automate tedious manual tasks at computer emergency response teams (or anyone else, who handles loads of data)
- drafting my synopsis of my doctoral thesis
- getting into retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
- waiting for my PCBs to arrive to finally build my first keyboard ðŸ¤—

[^1]: Computer Emergency Response Team
[^2]: Security Operation Center
[^3]: The review process of our paper was too long to claim CyBERT as a title.
[^4]: However, night sky photography is somewhat tricky in central germany.
