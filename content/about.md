Hi, I'm Philipp, father of *four little humans*, research associate at [PEASEC](https://peasec.de), and working on making the world's information more accessible.
My research focuses on process optimizations and information retrieval for security experts, but it translates to other domains as well.
To achieve this goal use natural language processing, information retrieval, and data mining methods.
As an example, my colleague [Markus Bayer](https://peasec.de/bayer) and I have trained a large language model for the cybersecurity domain called [CySecBERT](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3652594)[^cysecbert].

I'm also interested in automating dumb tasks, NixOS (and [using it for most of my machines](https://github.com/randomn4me/nix-flakes)), and I love to ride my bike whenever I find the time (with a strong interest in long distance cycling) ðŸš´
Besides that, I'm into photography (portraits and nature) ðŸ“·, like to [read](/books) ðŸ“•, play video games, and learn and try new things.

If you want to contact me, feel free to leave me a [message](mailto:blog@audacis.net).
I will read and answer them if you don't want to sell something.

[^cysecbert]: The review process of our paper was too long to claim CyBERT as a title.
