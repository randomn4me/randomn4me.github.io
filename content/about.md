Hi, I'm Philipp, father of *four little humans*, research associate at [PEASEC](https://peasec.de), and working on making the world's information more accessible.
My current research focuses on mitigating information overload for CERTs[^1] and SOCs[^2] and preparing the information used.
I use natural language processing, information retrieval, and data mining methods tailored to common information security tasks.
As an example, my colleague [Markus Bayer](https://peasec.de/bayer) and I have trained a large language model for the ITSec domain called [CySecBERT](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3652594)[^3].

I'm also interested in automating dumb tasks, NixOS (and [using it for all my machines](https://github.com/randomn4me/nix-flakes)), and I love to ride my bike whenever I find the time ðŸš´
Besides that, I'm into photography ðŸ“· I usually shoot portraits, nature, or the night sky[^4], and like to get a good [read](/books).

If you want to contact me, feel free to leave me a [message](mailto:blog@audacis.net).

[^3]: The review process of our paper was too long to claim CyBERT as a title.
[^4]: However, night sky photography is somewhat tricky in central germany.
