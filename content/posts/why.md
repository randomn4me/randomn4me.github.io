This is the usual place to give you some template like looking page, which presents you how everything will look like.
But since, I am not settled with the layout yet, and I think, it would be a waste of your time, I would like to rather give you a short introduction of, why I'm starting to blog.

The story begins with me wanting to write for my own (and others) a long time now.
One may ask
> "Why? Writing comes naturally, when you seek it out?"
but for me, it never came.

To this question I can only give you the following answer.
I always got caught in some kind of perfectionism, i.e., I never found the right tool for me and then never getting the start.
Once I tried [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), but it was never meant to be for me.
Then I tried to build my own static-site-generator but stopped half-way through and deleted, what I had.
I never knew what should be the topic, that I would like to spread to the world.
I didn't want to give too many details of what I am up to, but wanted to share something.
Most of the time I wanted to share all the nerdy tech tools I tinkered with, but without a platform to share, it never had been.
When I think back to that time, I would never have worked to publish something.
My focus was not there yet, and from what I think now about all of that, is that it should mainly serve me, and that was not, what I though of when thinking about blogging.

But with new plans flowing through my family, I wanted to just get this out of my head and document it, in the first place, just for us as a family, but you and all the other readers are of course invited to join us on that journey.
Now, some may ask

> "Will this be yet another blog about tech or travel or something else?"

Maybe it will, maybe it won't.
But the thing is, that I noticed that I need some kind of volume to empty my head and share my thoughts.
No matter, if it is about something that is currently happening in my life or some nice tooling I discovered.
Currently, I am even thinking about giving some more details about the research I have done over the years.
Moreover, is it meant to *document* our current situation as a family and the things, that are going to change for us.
So, I will write it down and try to keep it up to date as time allows it to be.

So the blog will probably span over
- General writing
- Tech
    - Nix and NixOS
    - Linux in general
    - Programming
    - Keyboards
- Photography
But it may also change over time.
