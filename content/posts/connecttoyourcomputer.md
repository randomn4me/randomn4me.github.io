When was the last time some broke down in your home, and you had to call a handyman? And have you peeked into the bags with good quality tools they bring with them? I personally have never seen a handyman who dismisses quality tools to get the job done and here is a guess, why this is: *they just don't want to pay the bill of not using them in the long run*.
Sure, you can get your job done with shitty tools that may break after some time.
And that may actually be okay[^1] in short term.
But in *"the long run"* it may cost you not just the regular replacement of tools, but you may also get health-wise problems of not using good tools.
As a handyman you might cut yourself because the screwdriver skid down, fall of that instable ladder, or suffer from long-term problems, because you used too much brawn while you instead could just have used a nice hammer drill to drill those holes in the concrete.
This is one of the reasons, why I think that handymen own those quality tools, they use every day of their lives.

But when we switch professions and look into offices, the whole mindset seems to shift.
How many of you, when starting a job, went to office on your first day and were greeted not only by your new and friendly colleagues, but also by this black block of plastic, a full-size rubber dome keyboard with that holy QWERTY[^2] layout, and a USB mouse that doesn't even have buttons for your thumb?
Even when there is scientific evidence, that touch typing on traditional layouts and keyboards is just wrong, we as humans are so used to just do what we know, that it won't change.

For me, this was definitely the case and I didn't know better, until a friend of mine and I got into ergonomic keyboard layouts, specifically [Bone](https://neo-layout.org/Layouts/bone/).
While he committed to learn Bone, because he wasn't touch typing until then, I stuck with QUERTZ, because I was just that much faster than with Bone.
But when I saw [this presentation](https://media.ccc.de/v/gpn22-498-tastaturen-ein-drama-mit-10-fingern)[^3] explaining the long term issues with traditional keyboard layouts (and keyboards), I was hooked again and started crawling deeper into this seemingly endless rabbit hole.
I checked out ergnomic keyboard layouts and because I always liked the ANSI layout a bit more than the ISO layout, I stuck with [Colemak-DH](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/)

<!-- TODO:
    - Those hurt you in the long run as well but never get discussed
    - There are way better alternatives and actual science to confirm bad setup (name dvorak, name paper on tenting from the 80s)

[^1]: It probably won't be okay since you need to keep buying the tools you need if they break. So the monetary and time-wise value still needs to be invested all the time.
[^2]: Or whatever the default layout there is in your country.
[^3]: The presentation is in German language.
