Really nice read to get an introduction into the life of Martin Luther King.
Since his life was not part of my school's curriculum, I learned a great deal in a short time, and as always, when reading about U.S. history, I am astonished by the amount of violence that shaped this country.
However, Europe also contributed to the cruelty of this world for a long time, but it seems to be largely under control since WWII - at least on that scale.
What makes me curious is the fact that owning and carrying guns seems normal in this country, while having high numbers of firearm deaths over the years is surprising [[Reference]](https://www.statista.com/statistics/258913/number-of-firearm-deaths-in-the-united-states/).
