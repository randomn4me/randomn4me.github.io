Really nice read to get an intro into the life of Martin Luther King.
As his life was not part of my school's curriculum, I learned a lot in quiet a short time, and as always, when reading about U.S. history, am astonished about the amount of violence that shaped this country.
Sure, Europe contributed to the cruelty of this world as well, for a long time, but this seems to be in check since WWII at this scale -- at least in Europe.
What makes me curious is the fact that it seems normal to own and carry guns, while on the other side having high numbers in *firearm deaths* for years [[Reference]](https://www.statista.com/statistics/258913/number-of-firearm-deaths-in-the-united-states/).
