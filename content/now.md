## Now

I'm currently looking for jobs based in the U.S. in the tech industry, so if you know someone (who knows someone (who knows someone, ...)), who is open for a chat, I would really appreciate it! Just contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipp-k%C3%BChn-724a7a320/) or via [mail](mailto:blog@audacis.net).

Besides that, I'm
- working on two different paper projects to mitigate information overload and automate tedious manual tasks at computer emergency response teams (or anyone else, who handles loads of data)
- drafting my synopsis of my doctoral thesis
- getting into retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
- waiting for my PCBs to arrive to finally build my first keyboard ðŸ¤—
