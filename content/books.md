This is a list of books that I have read.
I started compiling this list in 2024 and only included a few books from before that year.


## Current

- Black Hat Rust *(Sylvain Keykour)*
- The Art of Attack *(Maxie Reynolds)*

## 2025

- The Every *(Dave Eggers)*

## 2024

- Dune *(Frank Herbert)*
- Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity *(David Allen)*
- How to Take Smart Notes *(Sönke Ahrens)*

## Earlier

- Blackout *(Marc Elsberg)*
- Borne *(Jeff VanderMeer)*
- Celsius *(Marc Elsberg*) -- Started but not finished[^1]
- Der Schwarm *(Frank Schätzing)*
- Female Choice *(Meike Stoverock)*
- Gier *(Marc Elsberg)*
- Influx *(Daniel Suarez)*
- Limit *(Frank Schätzing)*
- Ministry of the Future
- Rethinking Conversation
- The Circle
- The Uninhabitable Earth
- Zero *(Marc Elsberg)*

[^1]: The book appears to have a storyline very similar to other Marc Elsberg books. After successfully predicting the next 50 pages of Celsius and finding that most of it came true, I decided to stop reading it.
